What is REST API?

To define "REST API", we have to know what is "REST" and what is "API" first. I'll do my best to explain it in simple terms because REST has a lot of concepts inside of it that could mean a lot of things.

REST stands for "REpresentational State Transfer". It is a concept or architecture for managing information over the internet. REST concepts are referred to as resources. A representation of a resource must be stateless. It is usually represented by JSON. 

What is API?

API stands for "Application Programming Interface". It is a set of rules that allows one piece of software application to talk to another. Those "rules" can include create, read, update and delete operations.

REST API enable your application to communicate with one or several applications using REST concepts which display data with minimum formatting using separators and delimiters (like JSON).

REST API Sample:

#GitHub REST API : https://api.github.com/users/adeleyeayodeji/repos

#Blog REST API : https://script.adeleyeayodeji.com/api/?token=c5c19e98afe0827d801f158abcde8d63&fbclid=IwAR31UyRULXCZDL81xOIc9wlWgKpJ7mO84_FPqFhKsw6P_4NtTIVlTMClW9Q
